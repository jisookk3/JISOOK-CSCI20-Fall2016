•Your name: Jisook Kim
•What is your major? Computer Science
•Why are you in this class? To learn computer language knowledge and improve programming skills
•What do you think you will learn? Excited but nervous. Hopefully I am able to be on the right page in class
•Anything else that you would like to share with the class (NOTE: this will be public so only post something you would like public).   
 I just changed my major for this semester. This class is new to me so I probably need more time to work on this class. 
 Hope I can interact with classmates with no language barrier because I am an international student. Anyway, nice to meet you guys!
