/*
1. Set the variable 'Com_num'
2. Set the variable 'User_num'
3. Set the variable 'Score' and save 10 points to 'Score'.

4. Give the computer a number range.  ex) 1~20
5. The computer selects a number randomly between the range.
6. Save the number computer selected to 'Com_num'.
7. Ask a user and get the number a user inputs(guesses) and save it to 'User_num'.

8. Comparison loop: Compare 'Com_num' with 'User_num'.

If User_num is higher than Com_num, tell the user "Higher" and lower 1 point from 'Score'.
If User_num is lower than Com_num, tell the user "Lower" and lower 1 point from 'Score'.
If two numbers are identical, get out of the comparison loop and print out "You win!" and the score (the value of 'Score').

Repeat the comparison loop until the value of 'Score' becomes zero. (Thus, it can be repeated 10 times at most.)

9. If the Score is zero, print out "You lose!"
